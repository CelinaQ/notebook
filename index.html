			  <h2>Hopes &amp Dreams</h2>

			  <p>As a photographer, I work with Photoshop all day long.  I often use a script to create files used for my company's <a href="http://www.houseofantiquehardware.com" target="_blank">website</a>.  I didn't write the script that I use, and if something needs to be changed, I have to ask the company developer to do it. I often have to wait for his response and go back and forth several times to ensure that we are on the same page about what is needed.  As someone who values efficiency, I'd like to be able to tweak the script if necessary without a bunch of back and forth.</p>

			  <p>I flourish in life when I'm learning new things.  I've had a camera in my hand since I was 4 years old.  The bucket of new knowledge from which I can draw in relation to photography is very small.  I'm very proficient with Photoshop, I have extensive experience with studio and set lighting, and I know how to create and analyze images.</p>

			  <p>With web development, the bucket of knowledge from which to draw is the size of an ocean for me.  It's unexplored territory in my life and that is incredibly exciting.  By the end of this class, I want to be able to create websites for clients.  I also want to know where to look when I need answers to my questions as I take on more complex challenges.  I would also like to establish good working relationships with my classmates so that we are able to assist each other professionally in the future.</p>

			  <p>Lastly, I am excited to use my new knowledge as a developer to increase my income. I'm not going to quit my day job anytime soon, but it will be fun to take on side projects to grow my skillset and gain experience while bringing in some extra income.  My plan is to continue working my salaried position with all the benefits that entails, and then see where this new (to me) knowledge base leads.</p>

			  <h2>Concerns</h2>
			  <p><ul>
			      <li>Right now my concerns have more to do with what will happen after this class has ended than with the class itself.  I have several friends who are developers, so I have resources to turn to if I have technical questions.  But how do I make myself valuable as a developer, especially since the pool of people doing this sort of work continues to grow?</li>
			      <li>How to specify CSS style for a single image if there are multiple images on a page.</li>
			      <li>How to center an image in an article.</li>
			    </ul></p>

			  <h2>Every card has a title.</h2>
			  <p>This card has a <strong>paragraph</strong> of
			    <span class="redText">text</span> with a <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">link</a>.  It also has a <i>second</i> <u>sentence</u> of <strike>text</strike> with a <a href="http://www.portlandcodeschool.com">link</a>.</p>

			  <p>A card is a simple unit of information.  We'll use the < article> tag to represent a card and then style it with CSS.</p>

			  <h2>Every card has a width.</h2>
			  <p><strong>But</strong> we <i>never</i> use pixels (px) to determine the size of a card.</p>
			  <p>We use measurements that <i>flex</i>, like percents (%) or that relate to the size of the content like <i>root "em"</i> units (rem), which relate the size of the elment to the text size and thus make the card very readable.
			  </p>

			  <h2>This card has lists.</h2>
			  <p>Lists are everywhere in web applications.  They are used for navigation (a list of links):</p>

			    <ul>
			      <li><a href="http://www.uniquevisionphoto.com">Go Here</li>
			      <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/celina.flores">Go There</a></li>
			      <li><a href="https://instagram.com/celinaq_q/">Go Someplace Else</a></li>
			    </ul>

			  <p>Or as a way to display sets of things</p>

			    <ul>
			      <li><span class="redText">Red</span></li>
			      <li><span class="blueText">Blue</span></li>
			      <li><span class="greenText">Green</span></li>
			    </ul>

			  <p>You will use lists a lot.</p>
